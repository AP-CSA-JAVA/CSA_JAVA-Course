# Unit 5


### 5.1 Anatomy of a Class

**Goals**
  - Understand the design principals of a class.
  - Use a nonprogramming methodology to design code.
  - Create a roadmap for the next activities.


A class is a blueprint for the objects of that class. A class contains variables and methods to store and manipulate information. To
create a class, you first state whether you want it to be public or private, use the class keyword, and name the class. Then, you
add a set of curly braces {} that will contain the contents of the class. To understand the key components of classes, we will
create an NewClass class. This is the class header:

public class NewClass {}

Inside the curly braces, you can define the variables and methods of the class. Variables are used to store data, and methods are
used to perform actions. In the NewClass class, we can create an instance variable to store the number of students in a classroom:

public class NewClass {

      private int numStudents;
}


### 5.2 Constructors
**Goals**
    - Understand the concept of class constructors.
    - Write your own class constructors program.
    - Examine call by value and reference with regard to class constructors.

### 5.3 Documentation with Comments
**Goals**
    - Understand how to properly comment code.
    - Implement precondition and postcondition commenting to summarize methods.
    - Use single-line comments to make code more readable and understand what tasks it performs.

### 5.4 Accessor Methods
**Goals**
    - Understand how to properly encapsulate the attributes of a class.
    - Write methods to display encapsulated attributes of a class. 


### 5.5 Mutator Methods
**Goals**
    - Understand how to properly encapsulate the attributes of a class.
    - Write methods to change the encapsulated attributes of a class. 


### 5.6 Writing Methods
**Goals**
    - Evaluate object reference expressions that use the keyword this.
    - Define behaviors of an object using non-void class methods with parameters.
    - Create new types using classes.
    - Write code to complete code segments.
    
    
### 5.7 Static Variables and Methods
**Goals**
    - Define behaviors of a class through static methods.
    - Define the static variables that belong to the class.


### 5.8 Scope and Access
**Goals**
    - Explain where variables can be used in a program


### 5.10 Ethical and Social Implications of Computing Systems
**Goals**
    - Understand the ethical and social implications of computing systems.
    - Understand beneficial and/or harmful effects of programs.
    - Develop awareness around the ethical issues applying to internet service providers.

Computing systems and it's affect on society: 
- Privacy: 
- Security: 
- Accessibility: 
- Censorship: 
- Dependence:
