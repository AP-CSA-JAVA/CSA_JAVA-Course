### Replit.com
By default, Replit uses Main as the main class.  To change the Main class name to a class name of your choosing, create a new file within replit and call it <i>.repl</i>.  Within the file type the following:

```
run="sh main.sh"

javac NewClass.java  # whatever that file is java NewClass
```

Lastly, make sure that the Main class is label correctly!  In this instance it will be called <i>NewClass</i>.

![replit](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12989939/186237117-a3565f6b-bc38-4edd-be59-f787ed233668.PNG)


Another method that you may find useful within replit is that you can create different programs and have them execute on the Main.java page.

```java
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    ProgramOne.main(args);
    ProgramTwo.main(args);
    ProgramThree.main(args);
  }
}
```
Example of this in use can be found [here](https://replit.com/@jonvirak/Array-Creation#Main.java).  Use this format for Assignment 2 and all future programs where you are asked to create two different programs.


```java

import java.time.LocalDate;
import java.time.LocalTime;
import java.time.LocalDateTime;
import java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter;
import java.time.Period;

public class DateTimeExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        printLocalDate();
        printLocalTime();
        printLocalDateTime();
        printFormattedDateTime();
        calculatePeriod();
    }

    // Method to demonstrate LocalDate
    public static void printLocalDate() {
        LocalDate date = LocalDate.now();
        System.out.println("Current Date: " + date);
    }

    // Method to demonstrate LocalTime
    public static void printLocalTime() {
        LocalTime time = LocalTime.now();
        System.out.println("Current Time: " + time);
    }

    // Method to demonstrate LocalDateTime
    public static void printLocalDateTime() {
        LocalDateTime dateTime = LocalDateTime.now();
        System.out.println("Current Date and Time: " + dateTime);
    }

    // Method to demonstrate formatting LocalDateTime
    public static void printFormattedDateTime() {
        LocalDateTime dateTime = LocalDateTime.now();
        DateTimeFormatter formatter = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss");
        String formattedDateTime = dateTime.format(formatter);
        System.out.println("Formatted Date and Time: " + formattedDateTime);
    }

    // Method to demonstrate Period
    public static void calculatePeriod() {
        LocalDate startDate = LocalDate.of(2020, 1, 1);
        LocalDate endDate = LocalDate.now();
        Period period = Period.between(startDate, endDate);
        System.out.println("Period between " + startDate + " and " + endDate + ": " + period.getYears() + " years, " + period.getMonths() + " months, and " + period.getDays() + " days");
    }
}

```
