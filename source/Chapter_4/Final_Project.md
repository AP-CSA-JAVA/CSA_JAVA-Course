# White Tower Project
  
Your White Tower Project is to design and develop a Java computer program of your own/ group choosing that addresses a need at your school, club, or community.   Please note that you have a limited amount of time to complete this project. 

### RULES FOR THE PROJECT:
1) You can work on the project by yourself or have a team of 2 or 3 people.
2) Written proposal that explains the need for you to write the program.
3) The project must be in java.
4) The project must be approved prior to you/ your team developing your program.
5) Your program must be created by you and/or your peers.  Downloading code from the internet will not be accepted.
6) You must comment out your code where appropriate.
7) You must have an explanation of the purpose of your program at the beginning of your program.
8) Your program should include: variables, arrays, nested iterations, loops, Boolean logic, constructors, toString
9) The program must work and be relatively bug-free in order to get full credit.
