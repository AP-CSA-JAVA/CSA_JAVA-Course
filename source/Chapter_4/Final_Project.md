# White Tower Project
  
Your White Tower Project is to design and develop a Java computer program of your own/ group choosing that addresses a need at your school, club, or community.   Please note that you have a limited amount of time to complete this project. 

### RULES FOR THE PROJECT:
1) You can work on the project by yourself or have a **team**<sup>1</sup>.
2) Written **Executive Summary**<sup>2</sup> why you decided to do this particular project.  
3) The project must be in **java**.
4) The project must be approved prior to you/ your team developing your program.
5) Your program must be created by you and/or your peers.  Plagiarizing code will not be accepted.
6) You must **comment** out your code where appropriate.
7) You must have an [**explanation**](https://ap-csa-java.github.io/CSA_JAVA-Course/home.html#java-style-guidelines) of the purpose of your program at the beginning of your program.
8) Your program should include, but not limited to: *variables, arrays/ arrayList, nested iterations, loops, Boolean logic, constructors, toString*, inheritance
9) The program must work and be relatively bug-free in order to get full credit.

 
<sup>1</sup> - A team is 2 or 3 people.  Each person must have a significant programming role within the group.

<sup>2</sup> - Executive Summary: project background, proposed solution, deliverables and goals, conclusion.
