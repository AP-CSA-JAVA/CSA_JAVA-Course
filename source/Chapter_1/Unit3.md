# Unit 3

## Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to performing logical “AND”, “OR” and “NOT” operations, i.e. the function similar to AND gate and OR gate in digital electronics. They are used to combine two or more conditions/constraints or to complement the evaluation of the original condition under particular consideration. One thing to keep in mind is the second condition is not evaluated if the first one is false.  For example, using the `&&` comparison, if the first expression is false, the value of the second expression doesn’t matter. Likewise, for the `||` comparison, if the first expression is true, the second value doesn’t matter.  When the result of a logical expression using `&&` or `||` can be determined by evaluating only the first Boolean operand, the second is not executed or evaluated. This is known as *short-circuited*.  This is used extensively to test for several conditions for making a decision.

    AND Operator ( && ) – if( a && b ) [if true execute else don’t]
    OR Operator ( || ) – if( a || b) [if one of them is true execute else don’t]
    NOT Operator ( ! ) – !(a<b) [returns false if a is smaller than b]
    
    
## 3.1 Boolean Expressions

**Goals**
-   Understand Boolean expressions.
-   Use relational operators to compute the value of a Boolean expression.


George Boole formulated the basic rules of Boolean algebra back in 1847. His endeavor created the mathematical logic that we use today.  Below are the relational operators that you will need to know for the AP exam.

| Relational Operator | Description | Boolean Value |
| :-----------------: | ----------- | ------------- |
| a < b | a less than b | Equates to 'true' if a is less than b,'false' otherwise |
| a <= b | a less than or equal to b | Equates to 'true' if a is less than or equal to b, 'false' otherwise. |
| a > b | a greater than b | Equates to 'true' if a is greater than b, 'false' otherwise. |
| a >= b | a greater than or equal to b | Equates to 'true' if a is greater than or equal to b, 'false' otherwise. |
| a == b | a equals b\* | Equates to 'true' if a has the same value as b. |
| a != b | a does not equal b | Equates to 'true' if a does not have the same value as b, 'false' otherwise. |

\* Sometimes this comparison can be misleading.  `==` can look at the value `a` and compare it to `b` to see if it is located at the same memory location.

| A | B | A \|\| B |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| false | false |       |
| false | true  |       |
| true  | false |       |
| true  | true  |       |


1.  Given `boolean` **variables** `a` ,`b` , and `c`, fill in the truth table for `a && (B || c)`.

| a | b | c | b \|\| c | a && (b \|\| c) |
| -----  |  ----- | -----  | ------ | ------ |
| T | T | T |  |  |
| T | T | F |  |  |
| T | F | T |  |  |
| T | F | F |  |  |
| F | T | T |  |  |
| F | T | F |  |  |
| F | F | T |  |  |
| F | F | F |  |  |

<details><summary>Solution</summary>

| a | b | c | b \|\| c | a && (b \|\| c) |
| -----  |  ----- | -----  | ------ | ------ |
| T | T | T | T | T |
| T | T | F | T | T |
| T | F | T | T | T |
| T | F | F | F | F |
| F | T | T | T | F |
| F | T | F | T | F |
| F | F | T | T | F |
| F | F | F | F | F |
    
</details>


In Java logical operators, if the evaluation of a logical expression exits in between before complete evaluation, then it is known as **Short-circuit**. A *short circuit* happens because the result is clear even before the complete evaluation of the expression, and the result is returned. Short circuit evaluation avoids unnecessary work and leads to efficient processing.

**&& short circuit:**
In the case of &&, the expression is evaluated until we get one false result because the result will always be false, independent of the further conditions. If there is an expression with &&(logical AND), and the first operand itself is false, then a short circuit occurs, the further expression is not evaluated, and false is returned.

**|| short circuit:** 
In the case of ||, the expression is evaluated until we get one true result because the result will always be true, independent of the further conditions. If there is an expression with ||(logical OR), and the first operand itself is true, a short circuit occurs, evaluation stops, and true is returned.


2.  Which of the following expressions will short circuit when `happy` is `true` and `pink` is `false`?  Why?

- [ ] ! happy && pink
- [ ] happy | | pink
- [ ] pink | | happy


<details><summary>Solution</summary>

An `&&` statement short circuits when the left operand is `false`. `!happy` is `false`, so `!happy && pink` will short circuit to `false`.
    
An \|\| statement short circuits when the left operand is `true`.  `happy` is `true`, so `!happy || pink` will short circuit to `true`.

```java
Input a number: 4
Input a second number: 5
4.0 is LESS THAN 5.0: true
4.0 is LESS THAN/ EQUAL to 5.0: true
4.0 is EQUAL to 5.0: false
4.0 is NOT EQUAL to 5.0: true
4.0 is GREATER THAN 5.0: false
4.0 is GREATER THAN / EQUAL to 5.0: false
```


## 3.2 If Statements and Control Flow

**Goals**
-   Gain an understanding of how to control program flow with `if` statements.
-   Start to implement control flow in more complex programs.

In Java, decision driven statements are used in conjunction with mathematical logical operators to navigate complex programs.  We use these logical operators below to differentiate solutions based on specific information.

- Less than: a < b
- Less than or equal to: a <= b
- Greater than: a > b
- Greater than or equal to: a >= b
- Equal to a == b
- Not Equal to: a != b

You can use these conditions to perform different actions based on the decisions from user input.  

The Java if statement is the most simple-decision making statement.  Java has the following conditional statements:

- Use the `if` keyword to specify a block of code to be executed, if a condition is `true`
- Use the `else if` keyword to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is `false`
- Use the `else` keyword to specify a block of code to be executed, if the above conditions are `false`
  


**Basic `if` statement format**
```java
if(condition) 
{
   // Statements to execute if
   // condition is true
}
```

**Example 1**

```java
class Main {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
	int i = 1;
	if (i < 5) {
  	    System.out.println("1 < 5");
            }
	System.out.println("This statement is outside of the if statement.");
  }
}
```

**Example 2**
```java
class Main {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        String str = "Your Name Here!";
        int i = 1;
	if (i == 1) {
            System.out.println(str);
            i++;
            }
        System.out.println("i = " + i);
  }
}
```

**Example 3**
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        boolean Yes = true;
        boolean No = false;
		
        if (Yes) {
            System.out.println("a is true"); }
        else {
            System.out.println("a is false"); }
		
        if (No) {
            System.out.println("b is true"); }
        else {
            System.out.println("b is false"); }
  }
}
```

Advantages of the `if-else` statement –

**Conditional execution**: The `if-else` statement allows code to be executed conditionally based on the result of a Boolean expression. This provides a way to make decisions and control the flow of a program based on different inputs and conditions.

**Readability**: The `if-else` statement makes code more readable by clearly indicating when a particular block of code should be executed. This makes it easier for others to understand and maintain the code.

**Reusability**: By using `if-else` statements, developers can write code that can be reused in different parts of the program. This reduces the amount of code that needs to be written and maintained, making the development process more efficient.

**Debugging**: The `if-else` statement can help simplify the debugging process by making it easier to trace problems in the code. By clearly indicating when a particular block of code should be executed, it becomes easier to determine why a particular piece of code is not working as expected.

**Flexibility**: The `if-else` statement provides a flexible way to control the flow of a program. It allows developers to handle different scenarios and respond dynamically to changes in the program’s inputs.


**Example 4**

```java
if (condition1) {
  // if condition1 is true then the blocks will be executed. 
} else if (condition2) {
  // if the condition1 is false, but condition2 is true then the blocks for block 2 will be executed. 
} else {
  // if both condition1 and condition2 are false, the else statement will be executed
}
```

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
	int age = 21;
	if (age < 12) {
             System.out.println("You are a child.");}
	else if (age < 19) {
             System.out.println("You are a teenager."); }
	else {
             System.out.println("You are an adult."); }

  }
}
```


**Note** *The body of an if statement in Java is not dependent on indentation. Indenting in Java is a strong convention 
that makes code segments readable. Java is often flexible about spacing. The three constructs below are equivalent and 
like indentation, spacing is used to improve readability.*

```java
// Example 1
if(b!=0){System.out.println("...");}

// Example 2
if (b!=0)
      {System.out.println("...");}

//Example 3
if (b!=0){
System.out.println("...");
}
```
  The `parseint` method is used to get the primitive data type of a certain String.

Following are all the variants of the `parseint` method:
- `static int parseInt(String s)`
- `static int parseInt(String s, int radix)`

`parseint` parameter details:

- `s` − This is a string representation of a decimal.
- `radix` − This would be used to convert a String s into an integer.

Return Value:
- `parseInt(String s)` − This returns an integer (decimal only).
- `parseInt(int i)` − This returns an integer, given a string representation of decimal, binary, octal, or hexadecimal (radix equals 10, 2, 8, or 16 respectively) numbers as input.


  **Note College Board Exclusion:** You will not be required to use the `parseInt` or `parseDouble` methods on the AP exam.


Look at the code below.

```java

import java.util.Scanner;
 
public class GuessChecker
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
    /* Add any variables you will need throughout the program here. */
  
    // Generate the random number
    String targetStr = makeCode();
    //System.out.println(targetStr);  // uncomment for debugging
    
    // Break the random number into four variables.
    int r1 = Integer.parseInt(targetStr.substring(0, 1));
    int r2 = Integer.parseInt(targetStr.substring(1, 2));
    int r3 = Integer.parseInt(targetStr.substring(2, 3));
    int r4 = Integer.parseInt(targetStr.substring(3, 4));
    
    // Get the user's guess.
    String guess = getGuess();
    //System.out.println(guess);   // uncomment for debugging
    
    // Break the user's guess into four variables.
    int g1 = Integer.parseInt(guess.substring(0, 1));
    int g2 = Integer.parseInt(guess.substring(1, 2));
    int g3 = Integer.parseInt(guess.substring(2, 3));
    int g4 = Integer.parseInt(guess.substring(3, 4));

    /*your code here*/
   
	}
 
  // Checks to ensure no duplicate digits in a int.
	public static boolean hasDupes(int num)
	{ 
		boolean[] digs = new boolean[10];
		while (num > 0)
		{
			if (digs[num % 10])
			  return true;
			digs[num % 10] = true;
			num /= 10;
		}
		return false;
	}

  // Creates a new random 4 digit code 1000-9999 with no duplicates.
  public static String makeCode() 
  { 
		int target = (int) (Math.random() * 9000 + 1000);
		while (hasDupes(target))
		  target = (int) (Math.random() * 9000 + 1000);
    String targetStr = target + "";
    return targetStr;
  }

  // Prompts the user for a guess and repeats until valid guess is made.
  public static String getGuess() 
  { 
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    boolean validGuess = false;
    int userGuess = 0;
    while (!validGuess)
    {
      System.out.print("Guess a 4-digit number from 1000 to 9999 with no duplicate digits: ");
      userGuess = sc.nextInt();
      if (!(hasDupes(userGuess) || (userGuess < 1000))) 
        validGuess = true;
    }
    String userStr = userGuess + "";
    return userStr;
  }
}

```

| Method Summary |      |
| -------------- | ---- |
| `getGuess()` | Prompts the user for a four-digit guess |
| `makeCode()` | Creates the random code that will try to be guessed |
| `boolean hasDupes(int sum)` | Used by `getGuess()` and `makeCode() to ensure that no digits are duplicated |


### Activity 3.2.1 guessChecker Pt 1

Modify the above code where you see `/*your code here*/` in the following ways:
- Use if statements to compare each digit in the user's guess to the digit in the same position of the random number to see if they match.
- Implement a "hit" counter that increase by one if the user's guessed digit matches the random number digit in the same position
- Display the total number of hits at the end of your program
- line 14: System.out.println(targetStr);  // leave this line uncommented

**Sample output:**
```java
3768 // random number that was generated
Guess a 4-digit number from 1000 to 9999 with no duplicate digits:  7658
Number of hits:1
Guess a 4-digit number from 1000 to 9999 with no duplicate digits:  3658
Number of hits:2
```

**NOTE** You will be building this program and making changes to it as we navigate the unit.  You will submit 1 program at the end of **Unit 3.5 Compound Boolean Expressions**


### Activity 3.2.2

**Sevens**

The number 7 is widely considered a lucky number, but in this game, you want to avoid it at all costs! Will you take the risk to rake in more points?

What You’ll Need:
- 2 Players
- 6 Dice

**How to Play** 

Agree upon how many rounds you’ll play and who will begin the game. The first player will then roll all six dice and remove any combination of numbers that add up to seven. The goal is to score the highest possible total by adding the numbers shown on the remaining dice.

The first player will have the option to roll up to three times during their turn. Once they have removed any sets of dice that add up to seven (this can include one or more sets), those dice are set aside and not used again for their turn. Add the numbers on the remaining dice to calculate the score. If the player is not happy with their score, they may roll again. However, any combination of dice that total seven must be removed. They may then choose to accept their score or take the risk of rolling again to increase points. Keep in mind that the second player may only throw as many times as the first player. For example, if the first player only rolled twice, then the second player can not roll more than two times.

The game ends once all the rounds have been completed, and the player with the highest score will be the winner!

**Instructions**
Write a program that includes the following:
- variables for player 1 and player 2
- input from the user to include a user defined number of `int rounds` (not to exceed 10 rounds)
- roll six dice and have the user be able to remove all but 1 die
- add re-rolls where the first player determines the # of rolls the second player can roll (max 3 re-rolls)
- total remaining dice and add them to player 1 or player 2, respectively
- declare a winner after `int rounds`



## 3.3 If/ Else Statements

**Goals**
-   Learn the if/else statement.
-   Simplify a complex program with if/else statements.


```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
  int grade = 95;
  if (grade >92)
	{
	System.out.println("You have an A in the class.");
	}
   else
	{
	System.out.println("You do not have an A in the class");
	}
  }
}
```

Take a look at the code below...
```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int Age = 25;
    int Weight = 89;

	if  (Age >= 18)
	{
		if (Weight > 90)
		{
			System.out.println("You are eligible to donate blood.");
		}
		else
		{
			System.out.println("You are not eligible to donate blood.");
		}
	}
	else
	{
		System.out.println("Age must be greater than 18.");
	}
  }
}
```
### Activity 3.3.1

**Starter Code:**  [starterFile_Shipping.txt](https://github.com/AP-CSA-JAVA/CSA_JAVA-Course/files/9913050/starterFile_Shipping.txt)

**Directions:**
*Shipping*
- [ ] ask user for the weight of package, method of shipping, and coupon code
- **Weight**
- - [ ] if weight is between 0 and 1, shippingCost is $1.
- - [ ] if weight is between 1 and 5,
shippingCost is $7.50 and add 1 day to shippingDays.
- - [ ] if weight is over 5, shippingCost is $10.25 and add 3 days to shippingDays.
- **Method of Shipping**
- - [ ] "Standard" adds 3 days to shippingDays 
- - [ ] "Express" subtracts 3 days from shippingDays and add $10 to shippingCosts
- - [ ] "Overnight" sets shippingDays to be 1 and add $20 to shippingCosts
- **CouponCode** If the user had the correct coupon code, subtract $10 from the shippingCost

**Sample Outputs:**
```java
Weight of Package:
0.5
Method of Shipping: Standard, Express, or Overnight:
Standard
Coupon Code:
none

Total Shipping Cost: $1.0
Days to Deliver: 8
```
```java
Weight of Package:
10
Method of Shipping: Standard, Express, or Overnight:
Express
Coupon Code:
none    

Total Shipping Cost: $20.25
Days to Deliver: 5
```
```java
Weight of Package:
7.5
Method of Shipping: Standard, Express, or Overnight:
Overnight
Coupon Code:
COUPON17 

Total Shipping Cost: $20.25
Days to Deliver: 1
```

### Activity 3.3.2

The Bill class can help you calculate a tip depending on the number of people who have dinner with you.

Complete addTip() method so it work like this:
- there are 8 or more people the tip is automatically 25%
- If there are 4 or more people (but less than 8) the tip is automatically 20%
- If there are 2 or more people (but less than 4) the tip is automatically 15%
- Otherwise, let the user decide on the percentage of the tip.

Use Main.java to test class method. Make sure to test for all possible outcomes.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Bill
{
	//attributes
	private double costOfMeal;
	private int totalCustomers;
  Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

    // Constructor
	public Bill(double totalBill, int numCustomers)
	{
		costOfMeal = totalBill;
		totalCustomers = numCustomers;
	}
	
	// Add a tip based on the number of guests

	public void addTip()
    {
    /* Your code here */

    }


    public String toString()
    {
        // Round the bill to two decimal places
        double roundedBill = Math.round(costOfMeal * 100) / 100.0;
        
        return "The total cost of the bill with tip for " + totalCustomers + " customers comes to $" + roundedBill;
    }
	
	
}
```
```java
// starter code
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main 
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
    int guests;
    double cost;
    Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
    System.out.print("Number of guests: ");
    guests = input.nextInt();
    System.out.print("Cost of meal: $");
    cost = input.nextDouble();
    Bill check = new Bill(cost, guests);
    check.addTip();
    System.out.println(check);
	}
}

```


## 3.4 Else If Statements

**Goals**
-   Learn multiple selections with the if/else-if conditional.
-   Continue to improve the code of a complex program.

A *multi-way selection* is written when there are a series of conditions with different statements for each condition. Multi-way selection is performed using if/else-if statements such that exactly one section of code is executed based on the first condition that evaluates to true.

```java
if (condition 1) // true
    {
    // body of the first 'if'
    // statement to be executed
    }
else if (condition 2) // if condition 1 is false
    {
    // if condition 2 is true
    // body of second 'if'
    // statements to be executed
    }
else if (condition 3) // if condition 2 is false
    {
    // if condition 3 is true
    // body of third 'if'
    // statements to be executed
    }
else // if condition 3 is false
    {
    // body of the 'else'
    // statements to be executed
    }

```

### Activity 3.4.1 guessChecker Pt 2

**Directions:** Modify your program to include “near hits.” These are correctly guessed numbers that are in the wrong position.

- Report actual `hits` at the end of the program
- Report the `near hit` counter at the end of your program 
- Use if/else-if/else statements

Comment where you made the changes include the date. No submission.

### Activity 3.4.2

**Instructions activityDirector:**
Write a program that will do the following:
- choose a random number for the temperature from 10 - 101
- if the temperature is greater than 95 or less than 20, print “Visit our shops!” 
- As the Activities Director, it is your job to suggest appropriate activities to your guests based on the weather.  Write conditional `else if` statements that meet the following requirements: 

``` 
  temp >= 80:           Go swimming!
  60 <= temp < 80:      Play tennis!
  40 <  temp < 60:      Play golf!
  temp <= 40:           Go skiing!
``` 

**Sample Output:**
```java
Temperature:
72
Play Tennis!
```
```java
Temperature:
100
Go Swimming!
Visit our shops!
```
```java
Temperature:
35
Go skiing!
```
## 3.4.1 Switch Statements - Oracle 

The switch statement is designed to be simple and fast and is not time-consuming.

- A case label can be literals: `characters`, `integers`, or `strings`.
- A case label can include mathematical operations whose result is an `int` (not a `double`).
- A case label can include a method invocation whose result is an `int`, `char`, or `String`.
- A case label does not allow comparison operators, logical operators, or object references other than Strings.

Inside the main method, we prompt the user to enter a number representing a day of the week (1-7).  We use a switch statement to evaluate the value of the `day` variable.  Each `case` represents a different value of `day`. If the value matches one of the `cases`, the corresponding code block is executed.  The `break` statement is used to exit the switch statement after a `case` is matched. Without `break`, the code would continue to execute the code for subsequent cases until it reaches a `break` statement.  If the value of day doesn't match any of the `case` values, the default `case` is executed, which sets `dayName` to "Invalid day."  Finally, we display the result to the user, indicating the `day` of the week based on their input.  When you run this program and enter a number between 1 and 7, it will display the corresponding day of the week.  If you enter a number outside this range, it will show "Invalid day."

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class SwitchDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a Scanner object to get user input
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Prompt the user for a day of the week (1-7)
        System.out.print("Enter a day of the week (1-7): ");
        int day = scanner.nextInt();

        // Switch statement to determine the day of the week
        String dayName;
        switch (day) {
            case 1:
                dayName = "Sunday";
                break;
            case 2:
                dayName = "Monday";
                break;
            case 3:
                dayName = "Tuesday";
                break;
            case 4:
                dayName = "Wednesday";
                break;
            case 5:
                dayName = "Thursday";
                break;
            case 6:
                dayName = "Friday";
                break;
            case 7:
                dayName = "Saturday";
                break;
            default:
                dayName = "Invalid day"; // This is the default case if the input is not 1-7
        }

        // Display the result
        System.out.println("The day of the week is " + dayName);
    }
}

```

Inside the main method, we prompt the user to enter a fruit name.  We convert the input to lowercase using `toLowerCase()` to make the comparison case-insensitive. This ensures that "apple" and "Apple" are treated the same.  We use a `switch` statement to evaluate the fruit variable, which is a string.  Each case represents a different fruit name. If the fruit matches one of the cases, the corresponding code block is executed.  Again, the `break` statement is used to exit the `switch` statement after a `case` is matched.  If the fruit doesn't match any of the case values, the default case is executed, setting the category to "Unknown."  We display the result, indicating the category of the entered fruit.  When you run this program and enter a fruit name, it will display the category of the fruit based on your input. If the entered fruit is not recognized, it will show "Unknown."

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a Scanner object to get user input
        Scanner myfruit = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Prompt the user for a fruit name
        System.out.print("Enter a fruit name: ");
        String fruit = myfruit.nextLine();

        // Convert the input to lowercase to make the comparison case-insensitive
        fruit = fruit.toLowerCase();

        // Switch statement to determine the fruit category
        String category;
        switch (fruit) {
            case "apple":
            case "banana":
            case "cherry":
                category = "Tropical fruit";
                break;
            case "grape":
            case "blueberry":
            case "strawberry":
                category = "Berry";
                break;
            case "orange":
            case "lemon":
            case "lime":
                category = "Citrus fruit";
                break;
            default:
                category = "Unknown";
        }

        // Display the result
        if (!category.equals("Unknown")) {
            System.out.println(fruit + " is a " + category + ".");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Sorry, I don't know the category of " + fruit + ".");
        }
    }
}
```

## 3.6 Equivalent Boolean Expressions

 **Goals**

-   Understand De Morgan’s Laws.
-   Students will work independently, but are encouraged to ask each other for help as needed.
-   Convert complex Boolean statements to conditional statements in code.



**De Morgan’s law** was developed by the mathematician Augustus De Morgan in the 1800s. He created them to interpret the negation 
of conditional expressions, like the expressions !(a > b) that you saw in the last activity.  This particular negation may seem simple, 
but conditional expressions can become complex when joined by multiple logical operators, for example, !((x < 3) || (y > 2)). De Morgan 
created simple laws, or rules, to help handle these types of complex conditional expressions. 

Specifically, De Morgan’s laws are:

    not (a and b) is the same as (not a) or (not b)
    not (a or b) is the same as (not a) and (not b)
    
    To better understand these laws, you can use the distributive property of mathematics:

    Law 1: not (a and b) is the same as (not a) or (not b)
    Starting with not (a and b), distribute the not and switch the logical operator to get (not a) or (not b). 
    In Java, this can be written as:

     !(a && b) == (!a || !b)
    Law 2: not (a or b) is the same as (not a) and (not b)
    Again, distribute the not and switch the logical operator to get (not a) and (not b) . In Java:
     !(a || b) == (!a && !b)
     
To apply De Morgan’s laws, distribute the not using the distributive property of mathematics and switch the logical operator (from and to or or from or to and).

De Morgan’s laws can also be applied to conditional operators. When negating conditional operators (such as <, >, >=), they become the opposite of what they are.

| Conditional Operator | De Morgan’s Law | De Morgan’s Law Applied |
| :-----------------: | :-------------: | :----------------------: |
| < | not < | >= |
| > |	not > |	<= |
| == |	not == | != |
| <= |	not <= | > |
| >= |	not >= | < |
| != |	not not equal |	== |

### Activity 3.6.1

[DeMorgan___Starter_Files.zip](https://github.com/AP-CSA-JAVA/CSA_JAVA-Course/files/9941153/DeMorgan___Starter_Files.zip)

**Instructions:** 

1.  In DeMorgansLaw.java, add the code to validate the first part of De Morgan’s Laws: not (a and b) is the same as (not a) or (not b).
 - Use two if/else statements, one for each expression.
 - Show output to confirm the results.
 - Test for all possible values of a and b (true | true, true | false, false | true, false | false).


2.  Continuing in DeMorgansLaw, add the code to validate the second part of De Morgan’s Laws: not (a or b) is the same as (not a) and (not b).
 - Use two if/else statements, one for each expression.
 - Show output to confirm the results.
 - Test for all possible values of a and b (true | true, true | false, false | true, false | false).

**Sample Output**
```java
Enter 'true' or 'false' for A
 true
Enter 'true' or 'false' for B
 false
NOT (a AND b) evaluates to true
NOT a OR NOT b evaluates to true
-------------------------------------
NOT (a OR b) evaluates to false
NOT a AND NOT b evaluates to false
```

3.  In DeMorgansLawIf.java, reproduce the compound Boolean expressions provided in the code without using logical operators. Instead, use nested if/else statements to duplicate their logic. Note there are two sections to modify, one to reproduce !(a && b) and one to reproduce !(a || b).
- Create truth tables if you find it helpful.
- Test for all possible values of a and b (true | true, true | false, false | true, false | false).


**Sample Output**
```java
Enter 'true' or 'false' for A
 true
Enter 'true' or 'false' for B
 false
NOT (a AND b) evaluates to true
NOT (a AND b) evaluates to true
-------------------------------------
NOT (a OR b) evaluates to false
NOT (a OR b) evaluates to false
```


4.  In DeMorgansLawGTLT.java, use De Morgan’s Laws to reproduce the provided if statement, creating a new if statement that uses a logical OR. Test for all combinations of positive, negative, and zero values.

- Comment where short-circuited evaluation could occur and describe how it could occur.
- Find the equivalent compound Boolean expression in one of your truth tables and use it to create the or version.

**Sample Output**
```java
//program with a negative input
Enter a number for X
 -5
Enter a number for Y
 19
Checking that both x and are not negative ... 
at least one number is negative
at least one number is negative

//program with positive inputs
Enter a number for X
 5
Enter a number for Y
 15
Checking that both x and are not negative ... 
Both x and y are not negative
Both x and y are not negative
```

### Activity 3.6.2 

**Body Mass Index (BMI)**

**Instructions**
Body Mass Index (BMI) is a person's weight measured in kilograms or pounds divided by the square of height in meters or feet. A high BMI can indicate high body fat. BMI screens for weight categories that may lead to health problems, but it does not diagnose the health of an individual.

| BMI | Weight Class |
| --- | ----- |
| < 18.5 | underweight |
| 18.5 - 25 | normal |
| 25.0 - 30 | overweight |
| 30.0 > | obese |

The formula for body mass index (BMI):

| Measurement Units | Formula |
| -------------- | ------- |
| Kilograms and meters (or centimeters) | BMI = weight(kg)/ height(m)<sup>2</sup> |
|           |  If height has been measured in centimeters, divide by 100 to convert this to meters. |
| Pounds and inches | BMI = (weight(lbs)/height(in)<sup>2</sup>) * 703 |

*[cdc.gov/healthyweight](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/childrens_BMI/childrens_BMI_formula.html)*

Your program must include two methods:
- the `bmi` method must take two double parameters `height` and `weight` and returns the `bmi`
- the `weightClass`method must take two double parameters `height` and `weight` and returns a string classifying the weight class. 
- The `weightClass` method must call the `bmi` method.
- Reminder: Use the Scanner class for input.  
- **Extra credit**:  allow the user to calculate in either Metric or Imperial standards.

```java
Would you like t ocalculate your weight using metric(m) or imperial(i) standard?
i

Height (in inches): 70.0
Weight (in pounds): 194.25
BMI = 27.868928571428572
You are considered overweight.

## 3.7 Comparing Objects

**Goals**
- Learn how to compare instances of classes to one another
- Create your own `equals` method for a class
- Practice `if` statements and coding skills

<mark >You may recall that the String class is included in the Java language package</mark> [(See java.lang)](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/package-summary.html).  When you create a String object from its class, the object is a reference variable. For example, the following declarations create two String reference variables.

`String s1 = null;`
`String s2 = new String("HELLO");`

Note that the value of the first reference variable s1 is null. It was not assigned an actual String object like s2 was. This reference variable, and in fact any reference variable, can be compared with null, using == or != to determine if the variable actually references an object.

**Note:** You do not need to use the `new string` constructor to create a string.  Instead you can use `String s = "HELLO"`.  The `String` constructor is used to demonstrate object equality.

**IMPORTANT: Object Equality**

In addition to comparing an object to `null`, the == operator can be used to test if two variables reference the same object. For example, consider the following code:

`String s1 = new String("HELLO");`
`String s2 = s1;`

If you were to compare `s1 == s2`, the result would be `true`. Both objects refer to the same storage location in memory. Compare the above code to the following:

`String s1 = new String("HELLO");`
`String s2 = new String("HELLO");`

Both `s1` and `s2` contain the same string, but they are different objects in memory, so the comparison of `s1 == s2 is false`. They are not the same object; they just happen to contain the same value. When comparing objects, `==` is used to compare object references (memory locations.) To compare the values of two objects, you must use a new method called `equals`.  Using `s1` and `s2` as an example, the syntax of the equals method is:

`s1.equals(s2);`

The `equals` method is a Boolean method that returns `true` if the contents of `s1` is equal to the contents of `s2`; otherwise, it returns `false`.

**Notes:** The == operator is used to compare object references, and the equals method is used to compare object contents. In other words, == checks if both objects point to the same memory location, whereas the equals method compares the values in the objects.

**Aliasing**

```java
1 public class ShapeEquals
2 {
3  public static void main(String[] args) 
4  {
5    Shape shape1 = new Shape();
6    shape1.setShape("Triangle", 3);
7  
8    Shape shape2 = new Shape();
9    shape2.setShape("Square", 4);
10  
11   Shape shape3 = shape1; <---
12    shape3.setShape("Hexagon", 6); <---
13    
14    System.out.println(shape1.getShape());
15  }
16 }
```
Take a look at the program above.  Looking at the program, you may have thought that the output of "shape1" would display "Triangle".  Look carefully at lines 11 and 12. When `shape3` is set to `shape1`, `shape3` points to the same address in memory as `shape1`. Any changes to `shape1` or `shape3` will change the contents of the memory, thereby changing the values of both variables. In Java, this is known as aliasing.  

**Note:** Two object references are considered aliases when they both reference the same object. Object references can be compared using == and != to identify aliases. 

### Activity 3.7.1

[137Clue.zip](https://github.com/AP-CSA-JAVA/CSA_JAVA-Course/files/10015355/137Clue.zip)


**Directions**  Review the current program as it is currently written. Look at "what works" and "what needs work". Make the necessary changes to the program so it produces the intended outcome (see sample below).

This program simulates Clue.

Here is what works:
- the program randomly generates a final murderer, weapon, and room
- prints out choices for the user
- asks user for final guess


Here is what needs work:

    we want to see if our guess is the same as the solution, but something is off with equals()
    check() should only get called if our guess isn't 100% correct

       - The table of the Suspect, Weapon and Room are not aligned.  Use \t to organize each column.
       - Should print "You have the correct muderer." if we have the correct muderer.
       - Should print "You have the correct weapon." if we have the correct weapon.
       - Should print "You have the correct room." if we have the correct room.


Extra: 
- Ignore case, use .equalsIgnoreCase()
- Allow the user to iterate through the program to pick the correct Suspect, Weapon and Room

**Sample Output:**

```java
Welcome to Clue! Choose one from each category.

Suspect     	Weapon      	Room
Miss Scarlett   Candlestick     Kitchen
Mr. Green   	Knife       	Ballroom
Colonel Mustard Lead Pipe   	Conservatory
Professor Plum  Revolver    	Billiard Room
Mrs. Peacock    Rope        	Library
Mrs. White  	Wrench      	Study
                		Hall
                		Lounge
                		Dining Room

Make you final accusation, separated by the enter key:
Miss Scarlett
Knife
Kitchen

Congratulations!
It was Miss Scarlett with the Knife in the Kitchen
```

<details><summary>New Java keyWord: switch</summary>

For the purposes of this program, you can use the jave keyword `switch`.  I discourage you from using it for the AP exam as it is not a part of the AP exam.  
Instead of writing many `if..else` statements, you can use the switch statement.  The switch statement selects one of many code blocks to be executed.  Take a look at the pseudocode below:

```java
switch(expression) {
  case x:
    // your code
    break;
  case y:
    // your code
    break;
  default:
    // your code
}
```
This is how it works:

- The switch expression is evaluated once.
- The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.
- If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.
- The break and default keywords are optional.
	- When Java reaches a `break` keyword, it breaks out of the switch block.
	- The default keyword specifies some code to run if there is no case match.

```java
int day = 4;
switch (day) {
  case 1:
    System.out.println("Monday");
    break;
  case 2:
    System.out.println("Tuesday");
    break;
  case 3:
    System.out.println("Wednesday");
    break;
  case 4:
    System.out.println("Thursday");
    break;
  case 5:
    System.out.println("Friday");
    break;
  case 6:
    System.out.println("Saturday");
    break;
  case 7:
    System.out.println("Sunday");
    break;
    default:
    	System.out.println("I don't even know what day it is!");
}
// Outputs "Thursday" (day 4)
```
	
</details>
