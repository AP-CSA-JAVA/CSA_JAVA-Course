## Boolean Expressions

| Relational Operator | Description | Boolean Value |
| :-----------------: | ----------- | ------------- |
| a < b | a less than b | Equates to 'true' if a is less than b,'false' otherwise |
| a <= b | a less than or equal to b | Equates to 'true' if a is less than or equal to b, 'false' otherwise. |
| a > b | a greater than b | Equates to 'true' if a is greater than b, 'false' otherwise. |
| a >= b | a greater than or equal to b | Equates to 'true' if a is greater than or equal to b, 'false' otherwise. |
| a == b | a equals b\* | Equates to 'true' if a has the same value as b. |
| a != b | a does not equal b | Equates to 'true' if a does not have the same value as b, 'false' otherwise. |

\* Sometimes this comparison can be misleading.  `==` can look at the value `a` and compare it to `b` to see if it is located at the same memory location.
