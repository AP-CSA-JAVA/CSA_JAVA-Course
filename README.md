# AP Computer Science A Course Overview 

AP Computer Science A introduces students to computer science through programming. Fundamental topics in this course include the design of solutions to problems, the use of data structures to organize large sets of data, the development and implementation of algorithms to process data and discover new information, the analysis of potential solutions, and the ethical and social implications of computing systems. The course emphasizes object-oriented programming and design using the Java programming language.

The following big ideas serve as the foundation of the course, enabling students to create meaningful connections among concepts:</br>
<b>Modularity</b>: Modularity in object-oriented programming allows usto use abstraction to break complex programs down intoindividual classes and methods.</br>
<b>Variables</b>: Variables create data abstractions, as they canrepresent a set of possible values or a group of related values.</br>
<b>Control</b>: Doing things in order, making decisions, and doing thesame process multiple times are represented in code by usingcontrol structures.</br>
<b>Impact of Computing</b>: Computers and computing haverevolutionized our lives. To use computing safely and responsibly,we need to be aware of privacy, security, and ethical issues.</br>

The following computational thinking practices describe what skills students should develop during the course:</br></br>
<b>Program Design and Algorithm Development</b>: Determinerequired code segments to produce a given output.</br>
<b>Code Logic</b>: Determine the output, value, or result of givenprogram code given initial values.</br>
<b>Code Implementation</b>: Write and implement program code.</br>
<b>Code Testing</b>: Analyze program code for correctness, equivalence,and errors.</br>
<b>Documentation</b>: Describe the behavior and conditions thatproduce identified results in a program.</br>

# Unit 1 - Primitive Types



## Why Programming? Why Java?

Every Java program begins with the creation of a class.  In this instance, we created a class called MyFirstClass.  Within the class there is a main method that is required to execute the program.  Below is a simple program that will print "Hello,World".  Notice that with every ' { ' there is a corresponding ' } '.  In class, you may hear me refer to it as a curly brace.  A missing a curly brace is one of the most common errors among new programmers.

Notice within the main method there is a print statement.  Let's break down this print statement. 
<p align="center"><b> System.out.println("Hello,World");</b></p>

- [ ] <b>System</b> is a class defined in the java lang package.</br>
- [ ] <b>out</b> is a public static field of the PrintStream type.</br>
- [ ] <b>println()</b> is invoked by the PrintStream class.</br>
- [ ] <b>NOTE</b> <i>println()</i> when executed will return to the next line. Whereas <i>print()</i> will execute the string literal but not return to the next line.

## Assignment - Create a class
- [ ] Create a main method
- [ ] Use System.out.print at least two lines
- [ ] Use System.out.println at least three times
