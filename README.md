# AP Computer Science A Course Overview 

AP Computer Science A introduces students to computer science through programming. Fundamental topics in this course include the design of solutions to problems, the use of data structures to organize large sets of data, the development and implementation of algorithms to process data and discover new information, the analysis of potential solutions, and the ethical and social implications of computing systems. The course emphasizes object-oriented programming and design using the Java programming language.

The following big ideas serve as the foundation of the course, enabling students to create meaningful connections among concepts:</br>
<b>Modularity</b>: Modularity in object-oriented programming allows usto use abstraction to break complex programs down intoindividual classes and methods.</br>
<b>Variables</b>: Variables create data abstractions, as they canrepresent a set of possible values or a group of related values.</br>
<b>Control</b>: Doing things in order, making decisions, and doing thesame process multiple times are represented in code by usingcontrol structures.</br>
<b>Impact of Computing</b>: Computers and computing haverevolutionized our lives. To use computing safely and responsibly,we need to be aware of privacy, security, and ethical issues.</br>

The following computational thinking practices describe what skills students should develop during the course:</br></br>
<b>Program Design and Algorithm Development</b>: Determinerequired code segments to produce a given output.</br>
<b>Code Logic</b>: Determine the output, value, or result of givenprogram code given initial values.</br>
<b>Code Implementation</b>: Write and implement program code.</br>
<b>Code Testing</b>: Analyze program code for correctness, equivalence,and errors.</br>
<b>Documentation</b>: Describe the behavior and conditions thatproduce identified results in a program.</br>

For this course we will be using various Integrated Development Environment (IDE) software to help you manage your programs, data files, & images.  
Coding Rooms will be our primary online IDE for this course.  For your personal development and collaboration, you may want to use an online IDE 
that will allow you to collaborate with peers.  If you are using a personal laptop, a good desktop IDE to install is VS Code.

# Why Programming Why Java

Every Java program begins with the creation of a class.  Consider a class as a blueprint for your program.  In this instance, we created a class called MyFirstClass.  Within the class there is a main method that is required to execute the program.  Below is a simple program that will print "Hello, World".</br>Notice that with every ' { ' there is a corresponding ' } '.  In class, you may hear me refer to it as a curly brace.  A missing a curly brace is one of the most common errors among new programmers.  The name 'public' allows users to be able to see the specific parts of your program.  Notice also that the name of the class starts with a capital letter.  The main class with always start with a capital letter.
![first_Java](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12989939/162324090-a9292f5d-3c02-46d8-bb05-e69cb0f72845.PNG)

Notice that within the main method there is a print statement.  Let's break down this print statement. 
<p align="center"><b> System.out.println("Hello, World");</b></p>

- [ ] <b>System</b> is a class defined in the java lang package.</br>
- [ ] <b>out</b> is a public static field of the PrintStream type.</br>
- [ ] <b>println()</b> is invoked by the PrintStream class.</br>
- [ ] <b>NOTE</b> <i>println()</i> when executed will return to the next line. Whereas <i>print()</i> will execute the string literal but not return to the next line. You can also create a new line inside a print statement by adding   <b>\n</b>  anywhere inside the quotation marks of a print statement.

## Comments in Code
Typing comments within your program is considered a professional practice, and I expect you to comment your code as appropriate throughtout the year.  There are two ways to comment in Java.  The first is a single line comment and you would use two foward slashes( // ) to indicate a comment.  The second is a multiline comment that uses a forward slash followed by an asterisks and closed with an asterisk followed by a forward slash ( /* */ )</br></br>
With **every** program that you submit, I want you to list the following: 
- your name/ partners name (if applicable) 
- the date of submission 
- Course 
- Period 
- and the assignment  
 
Please follow the convention shown below.</br>

# Variables and Data Types
There are eight primitive types in Java. In no particular order, they are int, double, boolean, float, char, byte, long and short.  For this course we will be using only int, double, and boolean.
- [ ] **int** is short for integer deals with whole numbers
- [ ] **double** is a 64 bit data type that stores decimal numbers
- [ ] **boolean** is used to represent true or false values
- [ ] **float** is very similar to a double but uses less memory
- [ ] **char** is a 16 bit unicode with a minimum value of \u0000 (0) to uffff (65,535)
- [ ] **byte** is an 8 bit integer with a range from -128 to 127
- [ ] **long** is a 64 bit datatype with a minimum value of -2^63 to 2^63
- [ ] **short** is a 16 bit datatype with a minimum value of -32,768 to 32,767

Non-primitive data types include a String, Arrays and Classes.
- [ ] **String** is a data type that is a collection of characters encompassed by quotes
- [ ] **Arrays** are used to store multiple values (think 'list')
- [ ] **Class** is an object constructor, blueprint, for creating objects.

### Variable Naming Convention
- [ ] Always choose a name that indicates the purpose of the variable
- [ ] A variable cannot begin with a number
- [ ] A variable must not have spaces
- [ ] A variable cannot begin with any special characters
- [ ] A variable cannot have the same name as a Java keyword

When you declare a variable, you must state the variable type along with the variable name followed by the value assignment to the variable.</br>  For example:  *int height = 72;*</br></br>
Once you have declared the variable type, you <b> do not need to do it again </b> to reassign a value to the variable.</br> Example:  </br>*int height = 72;</br>height = 70*</br></br>
If you declare a variable as *final* you cannot change the value of it.  We can refer to the *final* variable as immutable (unchanging).  Anotehr variable rule is that *final* variables are written as ALL CAPS to remind you that they cannot change.</br> Example:</br> final double PI = 3.14159;</br></br>

## Assignment 1
### Allowance
Write a program that will determine who receives an allowance or not.  Use the information below as a guide:
- [ ] Allowance is always $30.00/ week
- [ ] Non-teenagers do not receive an allowance
- [ ] Jon is 16 years old
- [ ] Ed is 12 years old
- [ ] Michael was born fours years before Jon
- [ ] Print out who receives an allowance and who does not by using an int, double and boolean variables.

**Example Output:**<br>
Jon's age is 16<br>
Eligible for allowance? True<br>
Jon's weekly allowance is $30.00<br>
<br>
Ed's age is 12<br>
Eligible for allowance? False<br>
Ed's weekly allowance is $0.00<br>
<br>
Michael's age is 20<br>
Eligible for allowance? False<br>
Michael's weekly allowance is $0.00<br>

## Assignment 2

# Expressions and Assignment Statements
Math Operators are a very important part of computing. Below are the most common operators that we will be using in this course.
| Symbol | Name  | Usage |
| :---:  | :---: | :---: |
| * | Multiplication | multiply two values together |
| / | Division | divide two values |
| % | Modulo | the remainder after dividing two values |
| + | Addition | add two values together |
| - | Subtraction | subtract two values |

**Note** When you divide an integer by zero your program will return an <i>ArthmeticException</i> error.

### Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally
In Java, the order of operation works pretty much the same with the exception of the modulo.</br>Take for example the following math equation: **5 + 12 * 18 - 10 / 2 % 2**

| Step  | Operation        | Result |
| :---: | :---:            | :---:  |
|  1    | Multiply 12 * 18 | = 216  |
|  2    | Divide 10 / 2    | = 5    |
|  3    | Modulo 5 % 2     | = 1    |
|  4    | Add 5 + 216      | = 221  |
|  5    | Subtract 221 - 1 | = 220  |

## Assignment 1
### Calculate your weight on Jupiter

```
The expression F=ma allows you to calculate your weight (in newtons) based on your mass (in kilograms)
the acceleration due to gravity on Earth (9.81 m/sec2). A typical mass of a human might be 58.9 kg.

F = ma
F = (58.9 kg)(9.81 m/s^2)
F = 578 Newtons
One newton is equal to 0.225 lbs. So on Earth, this human weighs 130 lbs.

F = (578 N)(0.225 lbs/ 1 N) = 130 lbs

But Jupiter is more massive than the Earth. The force of gravity is stronger, making the acceleration 
due to gravity much larger (24.79 m/sec^2). Below is a list of variables that will be used in the program.

Using the equation below, you can determine what your weight on Jupiter would be in pounds and not have 
to worry about converting units.

(weightOnJupiter) = (weightOnEarth)/1 x (jupiterGravity)/(earthGravity)

weightOnJupiter = 130
earthGravity = 9.81 
jupiterGravity = 24.79
weightOnJupiter = weightOnJupiter / earthGravity * jupiterGravity

```
**Using the chart below, create a program called GalaxyWeight that outputs information of the users weight
on three different planets and takes the average of those weights.  You will use the <i>scanner class</i> for 
this assignment.**

Dividing: 4 with remainder 0

```



# Compound Assignment Operators

In Java, you can modify a variable by referencing it, performing an operation on it, and assigning the result back to the variable. Thus, you can reference a variable to change its own value. For example, if x equals 0 , the following statement modifies x.</br>

```ruby
public class Main
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    x = 0;
    x = x + 1; //common programming convention
    System.out.println("x = " + x);
  }
}
Output:
x = 1
```

In algebra, this is an impossible statement, but in programming, the assignment operator makes this a simple and logical statement. 
To interpret assignment statements such as this, begin with the first instruction to the right of the assignment operator.

In Java, a strong convention is to declare variables close to where they are first used, at the beginning of a code block. 
A code block is denoted by curly braces, { }.  Notice that the print statement uses quotes around 'x = ' followed by plus(+) sign.
This is referred to as a **concatenation operator** where you can add a string literal to a variable.

Java like other programs has simplified the compound operators.  **Compound Assignment Operators** performs two tasks in one step.  It performs a mathematical calculation by and assignment.  It is written as:  
```ruby
x +=1

// notice the simplicity of the code versus the code below.
x = x + 1

// What would happen if you accidently type the plus sign in after the equal sign?
// How would that affect your program?
```

## Assignment 1
### Compound Operators
```ruby

public class CompoundOperators
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    int numPeople = 0;  
    double totalYears = 0;

    double years = 11.5;  // I will soon be halfway through my junior year.

    totalYears = totalYears + years;
    numPeople = numPeople + 1;
  }
}
```
- [ ] Rewrite the statements of the program above to use the compound assignment and/or the increment/decrement operators.
- [ ] TODO 1) Add at least three other people to your program, such as siblings, friends, or neighbors.
- [ ] TODO 2) Use people that are in different grades to validate your program can work for different school grades.
- [ ] TODO 3) For their years in school, use values that indicate they will soon be halfway through their current school year, as shown in the provided code.
- [ ] TODO 4)The average years you and your friends, siblings, neighbors have been in school.
- [ ] TODO 5) The total days you have all been in school, assuming you spend 180 days per year in school.
- [ ] TODO 6) The average days you have all spent in school.

<p align="center">---------------------------------------------------------------------------- </p>

When you are using replit, you can create different programs and have them execute on the Main.java page.

```ruby
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    ProgramOne.main(args);
    ProgramTwo.main(args);
    ProgramThree.main(args);
  }
}
```
Use this format for Assignment 2 and all future programs where you are asked to create two different programs.

## Assignment 2
### Average Test Score
Directions: Write two programs that will do the following:

**Average Test Score**
- [ ] ask the user for four test scores
- [ ] calculate and show the result

**Cashier Totals**
- [ ] ask the user for the number of burgers sold and how much each one costs
- [ ] ask the user for the number of fries sold and how much each costs
- [ ] display the total items sold
- [ ] display the total sales

### Example Output:
```
Enter the first test score:
95
Enter the second test score:
87
Enter the third test score:
74
Enter the forth test score:
75

Average test score: 82.75%
---------------------------------
Enter the number of burgers ordered:
10
Price of a burger:
5.65
Enter the number of fries ordered:
4
Price of fries:
1.95

Total Items Sold: 14
Total Sales: $64.3
```


# Casting and Range of Variables
There are some unique features to Java that help programmers create programs that are flexible in how they display data.  We learned earlier </br>
that we need to declare a variable by it's type.  It can be an int or a double.  As you may remember, an int is any whole negative or positive number.</br>
A double is any number with a decimal.  1.0 is a whole number, but it has a decimal. So, Java considers 1.0 as a double.</br>  
We can convert the double by declaring a new variable that changes the double to an int.

``` 
double temp = 98.6;
int newTemp = temp;
```
What is the value of newTemp?  Did you guess 99?  The actual value of newTemp is 98.  Java does not round unless you tell it to round.

You will need to be familiar with some terms:

- [ ] **widening** - converting from a smaller data type (int) to a larger data type (double).
- [ ] **narrowing** - converting a larger data type (double) to a smaller data type (int).

In this instance, we 'narrowed' the value of temp.  There is another term that you need to be familiar with and it is called **casting**.  Casting </br>
is converting from one data type to another, such as from a double to an int, potentially losing information. Take a look at this program:
```ruby
int eggs = 9;
final int dozen = 12;// a dozen will not change

System.out.println("Total eggs = " + eggs/ dozen);

Example output:
Total eggs = 0
```
We know that we don't have 0 eggs.  We can rewrite our program to show how many eggs we have in decimal form.
```ruby
int eggs = 9;
final int dozen = 12;// a dozen will not change

System.out.println("Total eggs = " + eggs/ (double) dozen);

Example output:
Total eggs = 0.75
```
If you were to print the variables of eggs and down, you would see that the values are 9 & 12 respectively.

# Project: Numbers Riddle

###Your First Project
In this project, you will write a program that incorporates the Java™ concepts you have learned throughout this unit.

Your program will include:

- [ ] Use of the camelCase naming convention
- [ ] Both multiline and inline comments
- [ ] The print and printtln methods
- [ ] Variables
- [ ] Arithmetic expressions
- [ ] The compound assignment operator
- [ ] Conversion between int and double data types

## The Numbers Riddle

<p align="center">Choose any integer, double it, add six, divide it in half, and subtract the number you started with. The answer is always three! </p>

**Important:** No shortcuts! You know the answer to the riddle will always be three, but your program is being used to test and validate the riddle. You should print the result of all calculations, not just “3.”

###Requirements of this project

Your program should allow any number to be stored in a variable and printed out. Then, the program should output its double, output six added to it, output that number divided in half, and, finally, output that number subtracted by the original number. In this way, the program displays each calculation, and of course, the final result of three.

Looking back at previous programs and the requirements stated above, you know you will need:
- [ ] a class definition header that matches the file name
- [ ] the main method of the program
- [ ] a variable defined as the “starting number you choose”
- [ ] six variables representing integer and double data types and positive, negative, and zero values (see details in Step 5)
- [ ] an algorithm(s) that processes the chosen number
- [ ] a print statement displaying the number you chose
- [ ] a print statement displaying each calculation and the final result
- [ ] comments in your code
- [ ] use of camelCase when appropriate

### Test Cases
Create variables and choose numbers that match the following six number types to verify your program works for each.  
- [ ] Positive Integer
- [ ] Negative Integer
- [ ] Zero
- [ ] One
- [ ] Positive Double
- [ ] Negative Double

## Document and Present

Create a slideshow of your program and how your program works. As part of your project documentation, you will take screenshots of your program’s code and output.
