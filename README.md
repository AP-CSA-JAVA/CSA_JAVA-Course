# AP Computer Science A Course Overview 

AP Computer Science A introduces students to computer science through programming. Fundamental topics in this course include the design of solutions to problems, the use of data structures to organize large sets of data, the development and implementation of algorithms to process data and discover new information, the analysis of potential solutions, and the ethical and social implications of computing systems. The course emphasizes object-oriented programming and design using the Java programming language.

The following big ideas serve as the foundation of the course, enabling students to create meaningful connections among concepts:</br>
<b>Modularity</b>: Modularity in object-oriented programming allows usto use abstraction to break complex programs down intoindividual classes and methods.</br>
<b>Variables</b>: Variables create data abstractions, as they canrepresent a set of possible values or a group of related values.</br>
<b>Control</b>: Doing things in order, making decisions, and doing thesame process multiple times are represented in code by usingcontrol structures.</br>
<b>Impact of Computing</b>: Computers and computing haverevolutionized our lives. To use computing safely and responsibly,we need to be aware of privacy, security, and ethical issues.</br>

The following computational thinking practices describe what skills students should develop during the course:</br></br>
<b>Program Design and Algorithm Development</b>: Determinerequired code segments to produce a given output.</br>
<b>Code Logic</b>: Determine the output, value, or result of givenprogram code given initial values.</br>
<b>Code Implementation</b>: Write and implement program code.</br>
<b>Code Testing</b>: Analyze program code for correctness, equivalence,and errors.</br>
<b>Documentation</b>: Describe the behavior and conditions thatproduce identified results in a program.</br>

For this course we will be using various Integrated Development Environment (IDE) software to help you manage your programs, data files, & images.  Coding Rooms will be our primary online IDE for this course.  For your personal development and collaboration, you may want to use an online IDE that will allow you to collaborate with peers.  If you are using a personal laptop, a good desktop IDE to install is VS Code.

<p>
This is a reminder that each student is responsible for their own work.  Assignments that are designated as team/ group assignments must have each students name within the block header.  Other assignments students may collaborate with another student, but each student must submit their own work and the assignment cannot be a facsimile of their peers work.  Submitted assignments that has another student's name on it and not your name will be considered as cheating and subject to the schools policy regarding plagiarism/ cheating.  Furthermore, assignments that have been deemed as plagirised will receive a '0' on the assignment.
