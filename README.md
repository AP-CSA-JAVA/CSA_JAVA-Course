# AP Computer Science A Course Overview 

AP Computer Science A introduces students to computer science through programming. Fundamental topics in this course include the design of solutions to problems, the use of data structures to organize large sets of data, the development and implementation of algorithms to process data and discover new information, the analysis of potential solutions, and the ethical and social implications of computing systems. The course emphasizes object-oriented programming and design using the Java programming language.

The following big ideas serve as the foundation of the course, enabling students to create meaningful connections among concepts:</br>
<b>Modularity</b>: Modularity in object-oriented programming allows us to use abstraction to break complex programs down into individual classes and methods.</br>
<b>Variables</b>: Variables create data abstractions, as they can represent a set of possible values or a group of related values.</br>
<b>Control</b>: Doing things in order, making decisions, and doing thesame process multiple times are represented in code by usingcontrol structures.</br>
<b>Impact of Computing</b>: Computers and computing haverevolutionized our lives. To use computing safely and responsibly,we need to be aware of privacy, security, and ethical issues.</br>

For this course we will be using various Integrated Development Environment (IDE) software to help you manage your programs, data files, & images.  Coding Rooms will be our primary online IDE for this course.  For your personal development and collaboration, you may want to use an online IDE that will allow you to collaborate with peers.  If you are using a personal laptop, a good desktop IDE to install is VS Code.

- [ ] Do not change any of the settings on the computers.
- [ ] Do not download/ install any programs (including games) to the computer.
- [ ] Do not access inappropriate content on the internet.
  
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


### Policy on Academic Honesty

- [ ] I encourage students to work with a peer on assignments.  It can make learning fun!  YOu may help with general problem-solving strategies, ideas, and algorithms, but **all solutions should be your own**. In practice, this means that, while students can discuss programs and questions, *all lines of code should originate from your own mind*. This course uses technology in ways no other course does. If you are unsure about the ethical implications of what you are doing, you should ask. Claiming ignorance is not a reasonable excuse.
- [ ] If you use other sources for help (websites, AI, friends, etc.), please cite them in the comments of your code indicating where you got help and whether certain sections of code came from that help.  Please make sure you understand any code that you use from another source. ChatGPT tends to generate compact and complex code, so make sure you read the explanation of the code and ask for simpler code if you don’t understand it. Never copy the text of my assignments into an AI tool to generate a complete solution. You can use AI tools and other sources for idea generation, code debugging, and help with understanding or generating small parts of code to get you started, but you should not have them do all of the work for you. <mark>Be in charge of your own learning</mark>, and make sure you learn what the goal of the assignment is asking you to practice! 
  
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


### Electronic Devices
- [ ] Students should be engaged during class, and cell phones and other electronic devices are a distraction that prevent students from fully participating in class. Specifically, students should not be accessing cell phones, smart phones, or any devices during class without permission from the teacher. Phones should be set to silent or turned off in class.
- [ ] Earphones, headphones, and other listening tools should not be used during class.
  
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Note-taking in learning
<details><summary>Click Here</summary>
<p>


- [x] So, you have the powerpoint, video, textbook, website and/ or whatever other resources were provided to you for this particular lesson.  <ins>Do you need to take notes as well?</ins>

Despite the vast amount of information available in electronic formats, taking notes is an <code style="color : red">important</code> learning strategy. In addition, the way that you take notes matters, and not all note-taking strategies lead to equal results.  By considering your note-taking strategies carefully, you will be able to create a set of notes that will help retain the most important concepts from lectures and tests, and that will assist you in your exam preparation.

### Two Purposes for Taking Notes

People take notes for two main reasons:
  1.	To keep a record of the information that was heard. This is also called the *external storage function* of note-taking.
  2.	To facilitate learning that you are currently studying.

The availability of information on the internet may reduce the importance of the *external storage function* of note-taking. When the information is available online, it may seem logical to stop taking notes.  However, by neglecting to take notes, <ins>you lose the benefits of note-taking as a learning tool</ins>.

### How Note-Taking Supports Learning

Taking notes during class supports your learning in several important ways:
  1.	Taking notes helps you to focus your attention and avoid distractions.
  2.	As you take notes in class, you will be engaging your mind in identifying and organizing the main ideas. Rather than passively listening, you will be doing the work of active learning while in class, making the most of your time.
  3.	Creating good notes means that you will have a record for later review. Reviewing a set of condensed and well-organized notes is more efficient than re-reading longer texts and articles.

Everybody takes notes, or at least everybody claims to. But if you take a close look, many who are claiming to take notes on their laptops are actually surfing the Web, and paper notebooks are filled with doodles interrupted by a couple of random words with an asterisk next to them reminding you that “This is important!” In college and university, these approaches will not work. Your instructors expect you to make connections between class lectures and reading assignments; they expect you to create an opinion about the material presented; they expect you to make connections between the material and life beyond school. Your notes are your road maps for these thoughts. Do you take good notes? Actively listening and note-taking are key strategies to ensure your student success.

Effective note-taking is important because it:

- [x] supports your listening efforts.
- [x] allows you to test your understanding of the material.
- [x] helps you remember the material better when you write key ideas down.
- [x] gives you a sense of what the instructor thinks is important.
- [x] creates your “ultimate study guide.”
  
There are various forms of taking notes, and which one you choose depends on both your personal style and the instructor’s approach to the material. Each can be used in a notebook, index cards, or in a digital form on your laptop. No specific type is good for all students and all situations, so we recommend that you develop your own style, but you should also be ready to modify it to fit your needs of a specific class or instructor. To be effective, all of these methods require you to *listen actively* and to think; merely jotting down words the instructor is saying will be of little use to you.

### Note-taking methods



| Method | Description | When to Use |
| --- | --------- | --- |
| Lists	| A sequential listing of ideas as they are presented. Lists may be short phrases or complete paragraphs describing ideas in more detail.	| This method is what most students use as a fallback if they haven’t learned other methods. This method typically requires a lot of writing, and you may find that you are not keeping up with the professor. It is not easy for students to prioritize ideas in this method. |
| Outlines	| The outline method places most important ideas along the left margin, which are numbered with roman numerals. Supporting ideas to these main concepts are indented and are noted with capital letters. Under each of these ideas, further detail can be added, designated with an Arabic number, a lowercase letter, and so forth.	| A good method to use when material presented by the instructor is well organized. Easy to use when taking notes on your computer. |
| Concept Maps	| When designing a concept map, place a central idea in the center of the page and then add lines and new circles in the page for new ideas. Use arrows and lines to connect the various ideas.	Great method to show relationships among ideas. | Also good if the instructor tends to hop from one idea to another and back. |
| Cornell Method	| The Cornell method uses a two-column approach. The left column takes up no more than a third of the page and is often referred to as the “cue” or “recall” column. The right column (about two-thirds of the page) is used for taking notes using any of the methods described above or a combination of them. After class or completing the reading, review your notes and write the key ideas and concepts or questions in the left column. You may also include a summary box at the bottom of the page, in which to write a summary of the class or reading in your own words.	| The Cornell method can include any of the methods above and provides a useful format for calling out key concepts, prioritizing ideas, and organizing review work. Most universities recommend using some form of the Cornell method. |


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


#### The Cornell Method

**Example:** The Cornell Method of Note-taking


![Cornell_Notes_Sample](https://github.com/AP-CSA-JAVA/CSA_JAVA-Course/assets/12989939/6123fb06-f099-4e9e-be37-dab810a49f6d)

The Cornell method was developed in the 1950s by Professor Walter Pauk at Cornell University [1]. It is recommended by many universities because of its usefulness and flexibility. This method is simple to use for capturing notes, is helpful for defining priorities, and is a very helpful study tool.

The Cornell method follows a very specific format that consists of four boxes: a header, two columns, and a footer.

The header is a small box across the top of the page. In it you write identification information like the course name and the date of the class. Underneath the header are two columns: a narrow one on the left (no more than one-third of the page) and a wide one on the right. The wide column, called the “notes” column, takes up most of the page and is used to capture your notes using any of the methods outlined earlier. The left column, known as the “cue” or “recall” column, is used to jot down main ideas, keywords, questions, clarifications, and other notes. It should be used both during the class and when reviewing your notes after class. Finally, use the box in the footer to write a summary of the class in your own words. This will help you make sense of your notes in the future and is a valuable tool to aid with recall and studying.

**Using Index Cards for the Cornell Method**

Some students like to use index cards to take notes. They actually lend themselves quite well to the Cornell method. Use the “back” or lined side of the card to write your notes in class. Use one card per key concept. The “front” unlined side of the card replaces the left hand “cue” column. Use it after class to write keywords, comments, or questions. When you study, the cards become flash cards with questions on one side and answers on the other. Write a summary of the class on a separate card and place it on the top of the deck as an introduction to what was covered in the class.
“I used to tape my lecture classes so I could fill in my sketchy notes afterwards. Now that I’m using the Cornell system, my notes are complete and organized in much less time. And my regular five-minute reviews make learning almost painless. No more taping and listening twice.”

— A student at Southern Methodist University

You will have noticed that all methods end with the same step: reviewing your notes as soon as possible after class. Any review of your notes is helpful (reading them, copying them into your computer, or even recasting them using another note-taking method). But THINK! Make your review of notes a thoughtful activity, not a mindless process. When you review your notes, think about questions you still have and determine how you will get the answers. (From the next class? Studying with a friend? Looking up material in your text or on the net?) Examine how the material applies to the course; make connections with notes from other class sessions, with material in your text, and with concepts covered in class discussions. Finally, it’s fun to think about how the material in your notes applies to real life. Consider this both at the very strategic level (as in “What does this material mean to me in relation to what I want to do with my life?”) as well as at a very mundane level (as in, “Is there anything cool here I can work into a conversation with my friends?”).

#### Instructor Handouts

Some instructors hand out or post their notes or their PowerPoint slides from their lectures. These handouts should never be considered a substitute for taking notes in class. They are a very useful complement and will help you confirm the accuracy of your notes, but they do not involve you in the process of learning as well as your own notes do. After class, review your notes with highlighter in hand and mark keywords and ideas in your notes. This will help you write a summary of the class in your own words.

### General Tips on Note-Taking

Regardless of what note-taking method you choose, there are some note-taking habits you should get into for all circumstances and all courses:

1.	**Be prepared:** Make sure you have the tools you need to do the job. If you are using a notebook, be sure you have it with you and that you have enough paper. Also be sure to have your pen (as well as a spare) and perhaps a pen with different-coloured ink to use for emphasis. If you are taking notes on your laptop, make sure the battery is charged! Select the application that lends itself best to your style of note-taking. Microsoft Word works very well for outline notes, but you might find taking notes in Excel to work best if you are working within the Cornell method. (It’s easier to align your thoughts in the cue or recall column to your notes in the right column. Just be sure you keep one idea per row!)

2.	**Write on only one side of the paper:** This will allow you to integrate your reading notes with your class notes.

3.	**Label, number, and date all notes at the top of each page:** This will help you keep organized.

4.	**When using a laptop, position it such that you can see the instructor and white board right over your screen:** This will keep the instructor in your field of vision even if you have to glance at your screen or keyboard from time to time. Make sure your focus remains with the instructor and not on your laptop. A word of caution about laptops for note-taking: use them if you are very adept at keyboarding, but remember that not all note-taking methods work well on laptops because they do not easily allow you to draw diagrams and use special notations (scientific and math formulas, for example).
5.	**Don’t try to capture everything that is said:** Listen for the big ideas and write them down. Make sure you can recognize the instructor’s emphasis cues and write down all ideas and keywords the instructor emphasizes. Listen for clues like “the four causes were…” or “to sum up.…”

6.	**Copy anything the instructor writes on the board:** It’s likely to be important.

7.	**Leave space between ideas:** This allows you to add additional notes later (e.g. notes on the answer to a question you or one of your classmates asked).

8.	**Use signals and abbreviations:** The ones you use are up to you, but be consistent so you will know exactly what you mean by “att.” when you review your notes. You may find it useful to keep a key to your abbreviations in all your notebooks.

9.	**Use some method for identifying your own thoughts and questions to keep them separate from what the instructor or textbook author is saying:** Some students use different colour ink; others box or underline their own thoughts. Do whatever works for you.

10.	**Create a symbol to use when you fall behind or get lost in your note-taking:** Jot down the symbol, leave some space, and focus on what the instructor is covering now. Later you can ask a classmate or the professor to help you fill in what you missed, or you can find it in your textbook.

11.	**Review your notes as soon after class as possible (the same day is best):** This is the secret to making your notes work! Use the recall column to call out the key ideas and organize facts. Fill in any gaps in your notes and clean up or redraw hastily drawn diagrams.

12.	**Write a summary of the main ideas of the class in your own words:** This process is a great aid to recall. Be sure to include any conclusions from the lecture or discussion.

13.	**Use notes when preparing for a test or doing an assignment:** Your notes usually have a summary of the most important points and are useful for making sure you incorporate important concepts in your assignments and for focusing on the main concepts when studying for tests and exams.

**What If You Miss Class?**
Clearly the best way to learn class material is to be at the class and to take your own notes. Regular attendance is expected, but life happens. On occasion, you may miss a class or lecture. When this happens, here are some strategies you can use to make up for it:
- Never ask: “Did I miss anything important?” (Think about what that’s saying and you’ll see it’s rather insulting.)
- If the instructor posts his or her lectures online... take notes. If the instructor uses PowerPoint slides, request a copy (or download them if posted) and review them carefully, jotting down your own notes and questions. Review your notes with a classmate who did attend.
- You may want to borrow class notes from a classmate. If you do, don’t just copy them and insert them in your notebook. They will not be very helpful. When you borrow notes from a classmate, you should photocopy them and then review them carefully and mark your copy with your own notes and questions. Use other provided resources to try and fill in the gaps. Finally, schedule a study session with the person who gave you the notes to review the material and confirm your understanding.
- If none of these options is available for you, use the course syllabus to determine what was covered in the class, then write a short paper (two pages or so) on the material using the class readings and reliable online sources. See your instructor during office hours to review your key findings and to answer any questions you still may have.

#### Group Notes: A Collaborative Approach

Groups within a class can take notes together using file-sharing software on the Cloud such as Google Docs. The individuals in the group can add to the document in real time as different individuals are adding themselves. This creates a collaborative document that all can use, download, (or adapt). This won’t work for all situations but can be very useful especially in a fast-moving classroom.

#### Keeping Your Notes

Class is over, and you have a beautiful set of notes in your spiral notebook or saved in your laptop. You have written the summary of the class in your own words. Now what?
Start by organizing your notes. We recommend you use a three-ring binder for each of your subjects. Print your notes if you used a computer. If you used note cards, insert them in plastic photo holders for binders. Group all notes from a class or unit together in a section; this includes class notes, reading notes, and instructor handouts. You might also want to copy the instructor’s syllabus for the unit on the first page of the section.

Next, spend some time linking the information across the various notes. Use the recall column in your notes to link to related information in other notes (e.g. “See class notes date/page”).
If you have had a quiz or test on the unit, add it to your binder, too, but be sure to write out the correct answer for any item you missed. Link those corrections to your notes, too.
Use this opportunity to write “notes on your notes.” Review your summary to see if it still is valid in light of your notes on the reading and any handouts you may have added to your notes package.
You don’t need to become a pack rat with your notes. It is fairly safe to toss them after the end of a course except in the following cases:

1.	If the course you took is a prerequisite for another course, or when the course is part of a standard progression of courses that build upon each other (this is very common in math and science courses), you should keep them as a reference and review for the follow-up course.
2.	If the course may pertain to your future major, keep your notes. You may not realize it now that they may have future value when you study similar topics or even the same topics in more depth.
3.	If you are very interested in the course subject and would like to get into the material through a more advanced course, independent study, or even research, keep your notes as a prep tool for further work.


**Key Takeaways:**
- Good note-taking is a key strategy for academic success.
- Choose among effective note-taking styles for what works best for you and modify it to meet the needs of a specific class or instructor.
- List notes are generally less effective and not prioritized.
- Outlines work well for taking notes on a laptop when the instructor is well organized.
- Concept map notes are good for showing the relationships among ideas.
- The Cornell method is effective for calling out key concepts and organizing notes for review.
- Instructor handouts and PowerPoint presentations help with—but do not replace the need for—personal note-taking.
- If you miss a class, explore your options for replacing your missing notes.
- Keep your notes organized in a way that makes it easy to study for tests and other uses in the future.

<p>
This is a reminder that each student is responsible for their own work.  Assignments that are designated as team/ group assignments must have each students name within the block header.  Other assignments students may collaborate with another student, but each student must submit their own work and the assignment cannot be a facsimile of their peers work.  Submitted assignments that has another student's name on it and not your name will be considered as cheating and subject to the schools policy regarding plagiarism/ cheating.  Furthermore, assignments that have been deemed as plagirised will receive a '0' on the assignment.

## Java Style Guidelines
<details><summary>Click Here</summary>
 <p></br>
 Please review the Java Style Guidelines
 
**Java Style Guidelines**

Here are guidelines for writing Java programs in this course.
#### Spaces

Put spaces on both sides of arithmetic operators.
```java
// Incorrect
a=(b*4+7.5/c);

// Correct
a = (b * 4 + 7.5 / c);
```
The keywords if, else, for, do, and while are always followed by a space. Put a space between a closing parenthesis and an opening brace. When a closing brace is on the same line as an else, follow it with a space.

```java
// Incorrect
if(a < b){
    for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++){
       j += i * a;
    }
}else{
    j = b * 9;
}
// Correct
if (a < b) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
       j += i * a;
    }
} else {
    j = b * 9;
}
```
Do not put spaces after an opening parenthesis or before a closing parenthesis:

```java
// Incorrect
for ( int i = 0; i < 5; i++ ) {
    sum = ( sum + i ) * Math.sqrt( 2 );
}
// Correct
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    sum = (sum + i) * Math.sqrt(2);
}
```
#### Braces and Indenting
There are several ways of placing braces in your Java source code. One thing they all have in common: closing braces are always the first non-whitespace character on a line. They are never placed at the end of a line:

```java
// Incorrect
if (a < b) {
    result = 22; }
else
    result = 99; }
```
Any of these are correct; the book we are currently using uses the third style:

```java
// Correct
if (a < b) {
    result = 22;
} else {
    result = 99;
}
// Correct
if (a < b)
{
    result = 22;
}
else
{
    result = 99;
}
// Correct
if (a < b) {
    result = 22;
}
else {
    result = 99;
}
```

Always enclose the body of an if clause, else clause, or loop in braces, even when there is only one statement in the body:

```java
// Incorrect
if (a < b)
    result = 22;
else
    result = 99;

for (int i = 0; i < 7; i++)
    result += i * i;
// Correct
if (a < b) {
    result = 22;
} else {
    result = 99;
}

for (int i = 0; i < 7; i++) {
    result += i * i;
}
```

You may indent either two or four spaces, and you may use the TAB character instead of spaces. You have to be correct and consistent in your indenting and placement of braces. Note how the if-else-if chain is aligned in the correct example:

```java
//Incorrect
if (a < b) {
    if (c >= d) {
      result = 2;
  } else if (e == f) 
{
        result = 99;
    }
  }
//Correct
if (a < b) {
    if (c >= d) {
        result = 2;
    } else if (e == f) {
        result = 99;
    }
}
```

#### Names and Declarations

Variable names begin with lower case letters. If you have a multi-word variable name, prefer camelCase to snake_case. If you have a final (constant), use all upper case for its name, and, if it is a multi-word name, use SNAKE_CASE. Names of Java classes begin with a upper case letter:

```java
// Incorrect
class example {
    int Counter;
    double unitprice;
    final double salestaxrate = 0.075;
    // ...
}
// Correct
class Example {
    int counter;
    double unit_price; // acceptable
    double unitPrice;  // preferred
    final double SALES_TAX_RATE = 0.075;
    // ..
}
````

Put only one declaration per line:

```java
// Incorrect
double cut, clarity, caratWeight, color;
// Correct
double cut;
double clarity;
double caratWeight;
double color;
```

#### Long Lines

Limit line length to 75, no more than 79, characters. Many IDEs will let you display a “line length marker” and set its limit. They might also show the current column number in the status bar at the bottom of the editor window.

Prefer multiple println() calls to one print() or println() with multiple \n:

```java
// difficult to read and edit
System.out.print("Weight: " + weight + "\nVolume: " + volume + "\nSurface Area: " + area + "\n");
// better
System.out.println("Weight: " + weight);
System.out.println("Volume: " + volume);
System.out.println("Surface Area: " + area);
```

If you break a formula across lines, you can break with the operator at the end of a line or beginning of the next line. Just be consistent.

```java
// Either of these is correct
double first = (weight * volume) / (length + width / 2 *
    height * height);
double second = (weight * volume) / (length + width / 2 
    * height * height);
```

#### Comments
The code tells you what the program does. Comments should tell you why or how. (The book will often have “what” comments because the book has to explain what a concept is.)

```java
// "what" comment
month += 1; // add one to month
// "why" comment
/* System returns 0-11 for January-December,
 * but people expect months to be 1-12.
 */
month += 1;
```

The exception to this guideline is the comments at the start of your program. These must have your name, the date, and a description of the purpose of the program. The description must be clear enough that someone who has not read the assignment will understand what the program does. These comments are incorrect:

```java
/*
 * Assignment 3
 * J. Fulano - Oct 4, 2525
 */
/*
 * Program uses if statements
 * and while loops.
 * J. Doe - Oct 4, 2525
 */
```

This one is correct:

```java
/*
* Ask user to enter a positive integer, and print out whether
* that integer is prime or not.
* Program does this repeatedly until user enters zero as input; 
* negative integers give an error message.
* J. Doe - Oct 4, 2525
*/
```

#### Loops

Avoid break and continue whenever possible; instead, carefully think through the loop condition. Do not use while (true) with break to substitute for thinking through the correct condition!
Consider the following code to read into an array until it is full or the user enters zero:

```java
// Very bad style
final int MAX = 4;
int [] ages = new int[MAX];
int value = -1;
int count = 0;

while (true) {
    System.out.print("Enter age or 0 to quit: ");
    value = input.nextInt();
    if (value == 0) {
        break;
    }
    ages[count] = value;
    count++;
    if (count == MAX) {
        break;
    }
}

// better
final int MAX = 4;
int [] ages = new int[MAX];
int value = -1;
int count = 0;

while (value != 0) {
    System.out.print("Enter age or 0 to quit: ");
    value = input.nextInt();
    if (value != 0) {
        ages[count] = value;
        count++;
        if (count == MAX) {
            break;
        }
    }
}
// best
final int MAX = 4;
int [] ages = new int[MAX];
int value = -1;
int count = 0;

while (count < MAX && value != 0) {
    System.out.print("Enter age or 0 to quit: ");
    value = input.nextInt();
    if (value != 0) {
        ages[count] = value;
        count++;
    }
}
```

#### Methods

Do not put a space between the method name and the parameter list.

```java
// Incorrect
static double cube ( double value ) {
    return value * value * value;
}
// ...
double result = cube ( 12.0 );
// Correct
static double cube(double value) {
    return value * value * value;
}
// ...
double result = cube(12.0);
```

It is a good idea to put comments before a method that describes the method’s purpose, inputs, and return value (if any):

```java
/*
 * Calculate monthly payment on a loan, given:
 * principal: amount of the loan
 * interestRate: annual percentage rate as a decimal (0.075 for 7.5%)
 * years: number of years of the loan
 * returns the monthly payment amount of the loan
 */
static double payment(double principal, double interestRate, int years) {
    //...
}
```

#### Output

When lining up output, prefer spaces and specific formatting over tabs:

```java
// OK
System.out.printf("Height (cm):\t\t%.2f\n", height);
System.out.printf("Weight (kg):\t\t%.2f\n", weight);
System.out.printf("Blood alcohol:\t%.3f%%\n", bac);
Height (cm):            160.30
Weight (kg):            50.40
Blood alcohol:  0.032% 

// Better
System.out.printf("Height (cm):   %6.2f\n", height);
System.out.printf("Weight (kg):   %6.2f\n", weight);
System.out.printf("Blood alcohol: %7.3f%%\n", bac);

Height (cm):   160.30
Weight (kg):    50.40
Blood alcohol:   0.032%
```
